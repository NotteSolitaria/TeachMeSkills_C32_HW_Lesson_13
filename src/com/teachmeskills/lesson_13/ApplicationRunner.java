/**
 * Create a class with a static method.
 * This method takes three parameters:
 * Login
 * Password
 * confirmPassword
 * All fields have the String data type.
 * The length of login must be less than 20 characters and must not contain
 * spaces.
 * If login does not meet these requirements, you must "throw" a WrongLoginException.
 * The length of password must be less than 20 characters, must not contain spaces, and must contain at least one digit.
 * Also, password and confirmPassword must be equal.
 * If password does not meet these requirements, you must throw a WrongPasswordException.
 * The exception classes WrongPasswordException and WrongLoginException are custom
 * exception classes with two constructors - one by default, the second
 * accepts the exception message and passes it to the Exception class constructor.
 * The method returns true if the values are valid or false otherwise.
 * Place the classes in packages: the class for checking values should be in its own separate package, and the classes for exceptions should be in their own.
 * Create a Runner class to test this class.
 * Try to solve the problem in two ways:
 * 1. using the methods of the String class "out of the box", for example the contains method
 * 2. splitting the string into an array of chars (string toCharArray()) and traversing and checking the array
